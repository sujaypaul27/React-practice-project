## 📌 Project Overview

This is a React-based Pizza Menu Web Application that dynamically displays a list of pizzas along with their ingredients, prices, and availability status.

The application includes business hour logic to display whether the shop is currently open or closed, and conditionally allows users to place an order during working hours.

This project demonstrates core React fundamentals such as component-based architecture, props, conditional rendering, dynamic list rendering using `map()`, and time-based UI logic.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic rendering of pizza items using `map()`
- Conditional display of "SOLD OUT" status
- Business hour logic (Open / Closed based on current time)
- Conditional rendering using ternary operator
- Reusable React components
- External order link integration
- Clean and structured UI layout

---

## 🧠 React Concepts Used

- Functional Components
- Props
- Conditional Rendering
- JSX
- Array Mapping
- Dynamic Class Names
- JavaScript Date Object
- React StrictMode

---

Each component follows the single responsibility principle for better maintainability and scalability.

---

## ⏰ Business Logic Implementation

The application checks the current system time using the JavaScript `Date` object.

If the current time is between 9 AM and 9 PM:

- Displays "We're Open"
- Shows "Order Now" button

Otherwise:

- Displays "We're Closed" message

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML
- CSS
- Vercel (Deployment)

---

## 📈 What I Learned

- Structuring a React application properly
- Passing props between components
- Rendering UI dynamically from arrays
- Using conditional rendering effectively
- Implementing real-world time-based logic
- Deploying React applications using Vercel

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add Add-to-Cart functionality
- Implement state management for orders
- Add filtering (Veg / Non-Veg)
- Add animation effects
- Connect to backend API
- Store menu data externally
